{{< /blocks/cover >}} {{% blocks/lead %}} 
Sitecore Commerce Cookbook contains recipes and menus to use with Sitecore Commerce. 

Just like a real cookbook, there
are basic recipes that teach you how to do simple things (like how to boil an egg) and more difficult recipes 
(how to make a souffle). 

Once you have mastered the recipes, you can start combining the recipes into menus to create more advanced features.
