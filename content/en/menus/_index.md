Menus are combinations of recipes which together form some functionality. For instance, a catalog import would be a menu where you would use the recipes for:

* creating the catalog;
* creating a root category;
* creating a sub category;
* creating a sellable item and attaching it to a category;
* setting the list price of a sellable item;
