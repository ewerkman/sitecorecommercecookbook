# Sitecore Commerce Cookbook

Sitecore Commerce Cookbook contains recipes and menus to use with Sitecore Commerce.

Just like a real cookbook, there are basic recipes that teach you how to do simple things (like how to boil an egg) and more difficult recipes (how to make a souffle).

Once you have mastered the recipes, you can start combining the recipes into menus to create more advanced features.

## About Hugo

The Sitecore Commerce Cookbook uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). Hugo is a fast and modern static site generator written in Go, and designed to make website creation fun again.
Hugo is a general-purpose website framework. Technically speaking, Hugo is a static site generator. Unlike systems that dynamically build a page with each visitor request, Hugo builds pages when you create or update your content. Since websites are viewed far more often than they are edited, Hugo is designed to provide an optimal viewing experience for your website's end users and an ideal writing experience for website authors.

## About Docsy

The Sitecore Commerce Cookbook uses the Docsy theme.

[Docsy](https://github.com/google/docsy) is a Hugo theme for technical documentation sites, providing easy site navigation, structure, and more. This **Docsy Example Project** uses the Docsy theme, as well as providing a skeleton documentation structure for you to use. You can either copy this project and edit it with your own content, or use the theme in your projects like any other [Hugo theme](https://gohugo.io/themes/installing-and-using-themes/).

You can find detailed theme instructions in the Docsy user guide: https://docsy.dev/docs/

This is not an officially supported Google product. This project is currently maintained.
